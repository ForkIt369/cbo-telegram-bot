# MCP Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've designed and implemented a production-ready multi-MCP (Model Context Protocol) architecture for the CBO bot that addresses the current limitations with stdio transport in containerized environments.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Architecture Design** (`docs/mcp-architecture-design.md`)
- Comprehensive design for multi-MCP server architecture
- HTTP/SSE transport for production compatibility
- Registry system for managing multiple servers
- Deployment patterns (sidecar vs embedded)

### 2. **HTTP Transport Implementation** (`src/services/transports/httpClientTransport.js`)
- Full HTTP client transport supporting both REST and SSE
- Authentication via API keys
- Timeout handling and error recovery
- Compatible with MCP SDK interface

### 3. **MCP Registry System** (`src/services/mcpRegistry.js`)
- Centralized configuration for multiple MCP servers
- Environment-based configuration
- Health check capabilities
- Dynamic server registration

### 4. **Enhanced MCP Manager** (`src/services/mcpManager.js`)
- Support for both stdio (dev) and HTTP (prod) transports
- Multi-server connection management
- Tool namespacing to prevent conflicts
- Health monitoring and reconnection

### 5. **Context7 HTTP Wrapper** (`mcp-servers/context7/`)
- Production-ready HTTP wrapper for Context7 MCP
- Docker support for containerized deployment
- JSON-RPC to MCP protocol translation
- Health endpoints and monitoring

### 6. **Deployment Configuration**
- Deployment guide for DigitalOcean App Platform
- Environment variable configuration
- Example app.yaml updates
- Security best practices

### 7. **Bot Commands**
- `/mcphealth` - Admin command to check MCP server health
- Updated `/tools` command to show server prefixes
- Enhanced help menu with MCP commands

## Key Features

1. **Production Ready**: Works in containerized environments without npx
2. **Multi-Server Support**: Can connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously
3. **Flexible Transport**: Supports stdio (dev) and HTTP/SSE (prod)
4. **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks for all servers
5. **Secure**: API key authentication for production deployments
6. **Scalable**: Each MCP server can be scaled independently

## How It Works

### Development Mode
- Uses stdio transport to connect directly to MCP servers
- No additional configuration needed
- Works with existing Context7 setup

### Production Mode
1. MCP servers are wrapped with HTTP endpoints
2. Deployed as separate services on App Platform
3. Bot connects via HTTP instead of stdio
4. Full tool functionality preserved

## Tool Naming Convention

To prevent conflicts between servers, tools are now namespaced:
- Format: `serverId:toolName`
- Example: `context7:get-library-docs`
- Claude sees the full name but users don't need to worry about it

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Test Locally**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Run Context7 HTTP wrapper
   cd mcp-servers/context7
   npm install
   API_KEY=test-key npm start
   
   # Terminal 2: Run bot with HTTP config
   MCP_CONTEXT7_TRANSPORT=http \
   MCP_CONTEXT7_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8001 \
   MCP_CONTEXT7_API_KEY=test-key \
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Deploy to Staging**:
   - Update app.yaml with new service configuration
   - Deploy Context7 HTTP wrapper as separate service
   - Test MCP connectivity

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Enable ENABLE_MCP_TOOLS=true
   - Configure production endpoints
   - Monitor health and performance

## Benefits

1. **No More npx Issues**: HTTP transport doesn't require npx in production
2. **Better Monitoring**: Health endpoints for each MCP server
3. **Independent Scaling**: Scale MCP servers based on usage
4. **Easy to Add Servers**: Just add configuration and deploy
5. **Backward Compatible**: Still works with stdio in development

## Environment Variables Added

```env
# Enable MCP tools
ENABLE_MCP_TOOLS=true

# Context7 Configuration
MCP_CONTEXT7_TRANSPORT=http
MCP_CONTEXT7_ENDPOINT=https://mcp-context7.example.com
MCP_CONTEXT7_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Additional servers (when ready)
MCP_PERPLEXITY_ENABLED=true
MCP_PERPLEXITY_TRANSPORT=http
MCP_PERPLEXITY_ENDPOINT=https://mcp-perplexity.example.com
MCP_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for adding multiple MCP servers to enhance the CBO bot's capabilities while maintaining production stability.
